# todo separate team and player odds
# todo the data in 1/0 may need one hot encoding
# todo may need to handle the missing values (proabbly just ignroe those cols)
# todo try setting none rather than zero for lower appearances
# backlogtodo find out when the best time for placing bets on various sites is (i.e. when do odds move)
# backlogtodo next prop - who scores last nba, race to 5 points
# backlogtodo compare top rank vs. bottom rank losses
# backlogtodo reverse engineer odds from site odds and use that to find mismatches in correlation i.e. last team to score
# backlogtodo convert from printing desired bets to putting them into a json/csv
# backlogtodo unsolved edge case: a player is traded then plays against their original team, having both on their record for the season. This may be solved by just taking the last index of team list, unless
# backlogtodo a solution to the edge case above: use the nba api team fetching for cases when there is a match
# backlogtodo look into multithreading for the multiple algorithm analysis (run the three concurrently)
# todo TEST optimized player spreads across exchanges (i.e. look at first point on fd, bovada and dk; Need to consider first field goal as well
# backlogtodo add player start percentage to 1st shot summary
# backlogtodo expand to NCAA which is offered on betmgm
# backlogtodo expand to other countries which are offered on betmgm
# backlogtodo write checker for updating all data that may need to be updated
# backlogtodo write checker for updating only game to game data (not rare breaking things like new players/player team pairs
# backlogtodo performance improvements, binary search of player db and smaller file size
# backlogtodo performance improvements, use in and index[itemIWant] for C native code performance improvements in numpy
# backlogtodo update print statements to show more and take up less space
# backlogtodo combine to update all relevant game dictionaries from last game after fetching new game details
# More books https://bookies.com/pennsylvania
# backlogtodo import decimal module or similar https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html
# backlogtodo look for when there is a big gap between the exchanges (not necessarily arbitrage) and just determine which is worse at their job. Take one side, not both, of the bets.

# backlogtodo set up backtester with assumed odds lines, i.e. assuming we are always offered odds on a team of -110, how would the strat perform? (the default should -110)
# backlogtodo set up backtester using pickled GameOdds objects
# backogtodo test if adding in the start of overtime tip performance enhances predictions (may be fatigue facotr/not as good)
# backlogtodo account for overrepresentation of playoff teams

# MISC
# todo investigate adjsuted starting rankings and prediction odds strength for low appearance players, i.e. if we can assume certain/lower mu values for a class of player we can improve our predictions
# backlogtodo (OVERKILL) have scheduler for scraping with randomized twice-a-day fetching and telegram alerts

# backlogtodo use this win prob/other win prob estimates over the course of a game to see if odds are mismatched https://github.com/swar/nba_api/blob/master/docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/winprobabilitypbp.md
